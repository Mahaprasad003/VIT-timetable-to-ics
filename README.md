# Timetable to ICS converter

Mostly solving a personal problem since I use Google Calendar a lot and wanted the timetable to show up on it.

Unexpected advantage for ios folks:
The official VITTY app usually used by students as calendar does not have a usable widget.
This way you can see your classes straight from your homescreen.

For android folks as well.

Small bugs may exist. Feel free to correct them or drop a DM to me.
